This repository contains the Homework 2 for the course in Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining (Sc.M. in Data Science)
Academic year 2018â€“2019.

The Code section contains a .ipynb file (HW2.ipynb) with the executed code and the outputs, and two .html files (arrivals.html and departures.html) which contain the output maps of question CRQ2 (since they are not directly visible in the code output)
