# ADM-HW2

### Group #18

This repository contains the Homework 2 submission of Group #18 for the course in Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining (Sc.M. in Data Science, Academic year 2018â€“2019)

The Code section contains a .ipynb file (***HW2.ipynb***) with the executed code for the homework (and the outputs), and two .html files (***arrivals.html*** and ***departures.html***) which contain the output maps of question CRQ2 (since they are not directly visible in the code output)

For completeness, here are the ***nbviewer*** links of the documents:
