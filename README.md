# ADM-HW2

# Group #18

This repository contains the Homework 2 submission of Group #18 (Francesca Porcu, Francesco Russo, Lohith Machani Sreenivasalu) for the course in Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining (Sc.M. in Data Science, Academic year 2018â€“2019)

The Code section contains a .ipynb file (HW2.ipynb) with the executed code for the homework (and the outputs), and two .html files (arrivals.html and departures.html) which contain the output maps of question CRQ2 (since they are not directly visible in the code output)
